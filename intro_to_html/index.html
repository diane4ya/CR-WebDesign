<h1>Greetings from HTML World</h1>
<p>We are in the age of social media. According to DataPatrtol.com, the average person spends about 2.5 hours a day on social media. With just one click of a button, anyone in the world can see what you have just shared whether it's a picture or a video. Once you make a post for the day it can be exciting to see all the likes, comments, and shares roll in, especially if your day hadn't been the best. Also connecting with old and new friends is also a plus. It's like your world just expanded and there's room for everyone. Social media has its benefits but it also has its drawbacks. Sometimes, being constantly connected on social media can be overwhelming and take away from real-life experiences. It's important to take breaks and prioritize personal interactions. Give yourself the chance to fully engage with the world around you and create meaningful memories offline. Three ways I think would help people balance social media and real life are; 1. Set Boundaries, 2. Engage in Offline Activities, and 3. Practice Mindfulness.</p>

<h2>Tips to help you Balance Social Media and Real-Life</h2>
<p> A few tips to help balance social media and real life would be to 1. Set boundaries, 2. Engage in offline activities, and 3. Practice mindfulness. First, setting boundaries I feel is key when wanting to balance your life and social media. By assigning specific times for social media and sticking to it you allow yourself dedicated periods in the day of uninterrupted real-life experiences. Second, to engage in offline activities you want to find hobbies you enjoy, possibly go out and explore new places, or simply spend quality time with loved ones. Third and final, practice mindfulness. Try to become aware of how social media makes you feel. If it starts to negatively impact your well-being or relationships, then that's a sign it's time to take a step back and reevaluate your usage. At the end of the day, it's all about finding what works best for you and prioritizing your mental and emotional well-being. Remember, YOU GOT THIS!</p>
