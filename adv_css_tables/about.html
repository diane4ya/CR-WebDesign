            <h1>Learning About Taking Time for Mental Health</h1>
            <p>Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, act, make choices, and relate to others. Mental health is more than the absence of a mental illnessâ€”it's essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.</p>

            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also influences how we handle stress, make decisions, and interact with others. Taking care of our mental health means recognizing and addressing our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in a way that promotes overall well-being. It's about finding balance, managing stress, and seeking support when needed. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and taking care of it is essential for living a fulfilling and happy life.</p>

            <h3>At Home Hobbies</h3>
            <p>First things first, it's maybe not the best idea to throw a dart at a random list of hobbies to choose one. Unless, of course, darts is your new hobby. Instead, try thinking about the kinds of things you like to do. You can do things like reading a new book, journaling, practicing yoga, or even listening to music. With all the stress of the world at the moment, finding a relaxing hobby seems like a sensible idea. They can give you some calm amidst the storm, and even help with your mental wellbeing.</p>
