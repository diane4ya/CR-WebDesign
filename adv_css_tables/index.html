            <p>Mental health refers to our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also influences how we handle stress, make decisions, and interact with others. Taking care of our mental health means recognizing and addressing our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in a way that promotes overall well-being. It's about finding balance, managing stress, and seeking support when needed. Mental health is just as important as physical health, and taking care of it is essential for living a fulfilling and happy life.</p>

With all the stress of the world at the moment, finding a relaxing hobby seems like a sensible idea. They can give you some calm amidst the storm, and even help with your mental wellbeing.</p>
